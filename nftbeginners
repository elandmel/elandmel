  &quot; It is not the critic who counts; not the
  man who points out how the strong man stumbles,
  or where the doer of deeds could have done them
  better. The credit belongs to the man who is 
  actually in the arena, whose face is marred by 
  dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly;
  who errs, who comes short again and again,
  because there is no effort without error and
  shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do 
  the deeds who knows great enthusiasms, the great
  devotions; who spends himself on a worthy cause;
  who at the best knows, in the end, the triumph of 
  high achievement, and who at the worst, if he 
  fails at least fail while daring greatly, so 
  that his place shall never be with those cold and 
  timid souls who neither know victory nor 
  defeat.&quot;
